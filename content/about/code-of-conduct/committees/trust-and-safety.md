> While the Trust & Safety Committee is being formed, any Code of Conduct violation reports will be reviewed and enforced by the executive team and Slack Community Leads. If needed, violations will be escalated to Techqueria's board of directors.

## Overview

Techqueria's Trust & Safety Committee is in charge of moderation and overseeing removals and bans from community.

They will implement and maintain a warning system, removal process and banning process that is documented and updated in [Techqueria's Code of Conduct](https://techqueria.org/code-of-conduct).

## Responsibilities

- Follow [Committee guidelines](https://techqueria.org/committees) to maintain and onboard the Trust & Safety Committee
- Review Code of Conduct violation reports and make a decision around removal or ban from Slack and other platforms
- Keep the Code of Conduct maintained and have it updated at least once per year based on learnings
- Maintaining a list of Code of Conduct violators and documenting reasoning for bans as well as cool-down periods

## Slack Channel

For committee updates and collaboration, the private channel is `#committee-trust-safety`.

All Code of Conduct reports pipe to the private channel `#meta-coc-reports`.

## Bias

- If a member of the committee has been reported, they must temporarily recuse themselves from the investigation and cannot vote in the decision.
- If a member of the committee feels they know the person who has been reported too well, they must temporarily recuse themselves from the investigation and cannot vote in the decision.
- If a member has been reported and they privately message any member of the Trust & Safety Committee, those communications must be shared with the rest of the committee.

## Edge Cases

- If a staff member (paid employee or contractor of Techqueria) is reported, the Trust & Safety Committee can still conduct an investigation but the final decision will be up to the Executive Team. If needed, the Executive team can escalate this issue to the Board of Directors.
- If a board member is reported, the Trust & Safety Committee can still conduct an investigation but the final decision will be up to the Board of Directors in accordance to bylaws.

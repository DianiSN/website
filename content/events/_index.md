> Starting in 2020, we have a dedicated events platform where we publish our events at [events.techqueria.org](https://events.techqueria.org/virtual-events/).

You can still find our past events here and in the future, we plan to consolidate them all here on our website.

Watch videos from our previous events on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Techqueria).

Read event recaps and other posts from our community [in La Techqueria](/news/), where we share our latest news and updates.

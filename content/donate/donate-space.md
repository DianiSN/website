Techqueria events are usually held at different tech companies across our different chapters.

Donating space for Techqueria events provides a great opportunity for our members to get a peek of your company environment while also supporting the growth and advancement of our members.

The number of attendees varies - from 20 to 200+ with most events happening on evenings during the week from 6 to 9 pm.

We'll get back to you if we have a need for your space.

## Responsibilities

- Helps onboard new Slack users
- Encourages users to post to the appropriate channel when applicable
- Invite new members to Slack
- Ideate on new content ideas for Slack
- Start discussions in channels of your interest
- Respond or escalate feedback about the Slack Community
- Respond to questions about the Slack community
- Moderates our Slack community by escalating any Code of Conduct violations to the [Trust & Safety Committee](https://techqueria.org/trust-and-safety)

## High Priority

- `#introductions`
  - Welcoming new members in `#introductions`
  - Point new folks in the right direction and make sure everyone knows the right channels to post in.
  - Welcome new members with HeyTaco - see [https://www.heytaco.chat/how](https://www.heytaco.chat/how)
  - Read new member introductions and invite them to certain channels based off that
      - e.g. if they're Mexican - invite them to `#mexicans`
      - e.g. if they're front-end - invite them to `#front-end`
      - e.g. if they're from LA, invite them to `#locals-la` and `#comida-la`
      - There are *a lot* of channels, so make sure to check out [this](https://techqueria.slack.com/admin/stats#channels) page for an overview of all the channels we have. Usually there are some that don't have as many people participating, so if we can invite people to those channels right off the bat we can drive engagement up!
- `#meta-request-channel`
  - Review pinned posts before creating a channel
  - Make sure members follow guidelines before deciding whether or not to create a new channel
      - We don't want to have too many channels where there is very little activity
- `#meta`
  - Responding to feedback or questions
  - Redirecting folks to the right channel (using switch channel emoji for example)
  - Redirect members from other channels to post there
- **New Members**
  - Send out invitations to folks applying to join our Slack using this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZBPjrBgC8WqVhrbJDZQXjE6r5w9c-ikse29ZrZ14shE/edit#gid=145770484). Feel free to send out the custom message when sending out the invite to our new members.
      - Google Sheet is pinned in `#techqueria-slack` channel
      - Make sure they have a valid Linkedin address and are not Code of Conduct violators.
      - We're growing rapidly and making sure we're bringing in new folks in a timely manner is super important!

## Medium Priority

- `#announcements`

    Make sure to always send a draft in `#meta-slack-community` before posting in `#announcements`.

    - Member highlights
        - Keep up with weekly member highlight
        - Identify candidates to give a shout out to (e.g. ‚ÄúI think the following Techquerx should be highlighted because blah‚Äù)
        - Draft up member highlight and get feedback from other leaders
    - Recommended Slack Channels
        - Use Slack analytics dashboard to get a sense of what's going on
        - Bi-weekly updates
- `#meta-slack-community`
    - Responding to feedback or questions in this channel

## Low Priority

- `#meta-profile-pic`
    - This channel keeps track of messages reacted with üñºÔ∏è which means the person needs to upload a photo
    - Saying ‚Äúprofile picture‚Äù in a message should also trigger a Slackbot message
    - We want to encourage our users to upload
- **Contribute back to the documentation**
    - Help us onboard the next cohort of Techqueria Slack Community Leads to help support this thriving community of Latinx folks in tech!

## Meetings

- **1:1 Meetings**
    - If you need to discuss something in private or just want help triaging an issue, feel free to reach out to us in `#techqueria-slack` if you want to jump on a quick call
- **Questions?**
    - Let us know in `#meta-slack-community`
